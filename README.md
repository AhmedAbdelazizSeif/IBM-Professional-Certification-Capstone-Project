# IBM-Professional-Certification-Capstone-Project
# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This repository contains the data analysis and prediction model for the success of the first stage landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket launches. The prediction is based on a dataset that includes variables like flight number, date, booster version, payload mass, orbit, launch site, and many others.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the power of machine learning to predict the successful landing of Falcon 9's first stage, which in turn informs the cost of a launch. This information is crucial for alternate launch providers who aim to bid competitively against SpaceX.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. These are listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. Explore the `notebooks` directory for Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration and model building process.

4. The `src` directory contains the Python scripts for data processing and the machine learning model.

5. Trained model can be found in the `output` directory.
